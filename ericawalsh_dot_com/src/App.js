            I earned my Master's degree at Columbia in biology, and after
            spending some time learning how to run a business at a
            science-education startup, I pivoted and joined a fast moving
            eCommerce startup, which was acquired by one of the largest
            retailers in our nation. There I had a front-row seat to the
            competitive retail tech industry, which sparked my desire to become
            a web developer.

            This unique mix of education and professional experience has given
            me the ability to think critically and approach complex problems
            from a variety of angles, while keeping the customer top of mind.
